# instaGrabber
instaGrabber is a simple webscraper built using selenium to scrape image posts from specific Instagram profiles

I have included geckodriver in the repository for easy setup. I do not guarantee that it works, since Instagram updating their webpage might break the application and I do not actively maintain this project.
